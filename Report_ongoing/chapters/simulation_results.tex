Evaluate results in simulation.

\section{Tri-copter}
\label{sec:tri_copter_sim}

The tri-copter with tilting rotor is an interesting case because it is holonomic,
which means that it has exactly six degrees of freedom (DoF) and evolves in a
three dimensional space. As it can be observed in \Cref{fig:Tricopter_fspace}
and \Cref{fig:Tricopter_fspace}, it can produce force and torque in any direction.
