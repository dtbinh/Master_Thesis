Selecting an optimal morphology of an omni-directional flying platform with changing
propeller axes is not a straightforward problem. Various factors influence the desired
morphology, such as flight efficiency, omni-directionality, and control authority.
In the present work the development of a tool that solves the design optimization
problem for a tilt-rotor MAV is presented. Different optimal morphologies are
then acquired. Finally, a verification of the proposed platforms is completed
in different simulations.
