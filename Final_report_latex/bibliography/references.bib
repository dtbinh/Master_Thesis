Based on a static force and torque analysis for generic actuator configurations, we derive an eight-rotor configuration that maximizes the vehicle's agility in any direction. The proposed vehicle design possesses full force and torque authority in all three dimensions. A control strategy that allows for exploiting the vehicle's decoupled translational and rotational dynamics is introduced. A prototype of the proposed vehicle design is built using reversible motor-propeller actuators and capable of flying at any orientation. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the novel design and the capabilities of the vehicle.},

	abstract = {In this paper a novel aerial manipulation system is proposed. The mechanical structure of the system, the number of thrusters and their geometry will be derived from technical optimization problems. The aforementioned problems are defined by taking into consideration the desired actuation forces and torques applied to the end-effector of the system. The framework of the proposed system is designed in a CAD Package in order to evaluate the system parameter values. Following this, the kinematic and dynamic models are developed and an adaptive backstepping controller is designed aiming to control the exact position and orientation of the end-effector in the Cartesian space. Finally, the performance of the system is demonstrated through a simulation study, where a manipulation task scenario is investigated.},

	abstract = {Extending the maneuverability of unmanned areal vehicles promises to yield a considerable increase in the areas in which these systems can be used. Some such applications are the performance of more complicated inspection tasks and the generation of complex uninterrupted movements of an attached camera. In this paper we address this challenge by presenting Voliro, a novel aerial platform that combines the advantages of existing multi-rotor systems with the agility of omnidirectionally controllable platforms. We propose the use of a hexacopter with tiltable rotors allowing the system to decouple the control of position and orientation. The contributions of this work involve the mechanical design as well as a controller with the corresponding allocation scheme. This work also discusses the design challenges involved when turning the concept of a hexacopter with tiltable rotors into an actual prototype. The agility of the system is demonstrated and evaluated in real- world experiments.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical study on omnidirectional aerial vehicles with body-frame ﬁxed unidirectional thrusters. Omniplus multi-rotor designs are deﬁned as the ones that allow to exert a total wrench in any direction using positiveonly lift force and drag moment (i.e., positive rotational speed) for each rotor blade. Algebraic conditions for a design to be omniplus are derived, a simple necessary condition being the fact that at least seven propellers have to be used. An energy optimal design strategy is then deﬁned as the one minimizing the maximum norm of the input set needed to span a certain wrench ellipsoid for the adopted input allocation strategy. Two corresponding major design criteria are then introduced: ﬁrstly, a minimum allocation-matrix condition number aims at an equal sharing of the effort needed to generate wrenches in any direction; secondly, imposing a balanced design guarantees an equal sharing of the extra effort needed to keep the input in the non-negative orthant. We propose a numerical algorithm to solve such optimal design problem and a control algorithm to control any omnidirectional platform. The work is concluded with informative simulation results in non-ideal conditions.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139759},
	abstract = {Mobility of a hexarotor UAV in its standard configuration is limited, since all the propeller force vectors are parallel and they achieve only 4-DoF actuation, similar, e.g., to quadrotors. As a consequence, the hexarotor pose cannot track an arbitrary trajectory while the center of mass is tracking a position trajectory. In this paper, we consider a different hexarotor architecture where propellers are tilted, without the need of any additional hardware. In this way, the hexarotor gains a 6-DoF actuation which allows to independently reach positions and orientations in free space and to be able to exert forces on the environment to resist any wrench for aerial manipulation tasks. After deriving the dynamical model of the proposed hexarotor, we discuss the controllability and the tilt angle optimization to reduce the control effort for the specific task. An exact feedback linearization and decoupling control law is proposed based on the input-output mapping, considering the Jacobian and task acceleration, for non-linear trajectory tracking. The capabilities of our approach are shown by simulation results.},

	abstract = {In this work we present the optimization-based design and control of a fully-actuated omnidirectional hexarotor. The tilt angles of the propellers are designed by maximizing the control wrench applied by the propellers. This maximizes (a) the agility of the UAV, (b) the maximum payload the UAV can hover with at any orientation, and (c) the interaction wrench that the UAV can apply to the environment in physical contact. It is shown that only axial tilting of the propellers with respect to the UAV's body yields optimal results. Unlike the conventional hexarotor, the proposed hexarotor can generate at least 1.9 times the maximum thrust of one rotor in any direction, in addition to the higher control torque around the vehicle's upward axis. A geometric controller on SE(3) is proposed for the trajectory tracking problem for the class of fully actuated UAVs. The proposed controller avoids singularities and complexities that arise when using local parametrizations, in addition to being invariant to a change of inertial coordinate frame. The performance of the controller is validated in simulation.},

Due to this omni-directional wrench generation, the ODAR system can realize such powerful behaviors impossible with conventional multi-rotor flying platforms as: 360° photo/video shooting while holding its position for VR scene generation; or resisting sideway gust while keeping its attitude and exerting downward pushing force larger than its own weight for aerial manipulation applications. This paper presents optimal mechanical design, modeling and control, hardware and software implementation, and experimental verification of the ability of the ODAR system to attain those behaviors impossible with the conventional drones as stated above.},

	abstract = {Standard quadrotor UAVs possess a limited mobility because of their inherent underactuation, i.e., availability of 4 independent control inputs (the 4 propeller spinning velocities) vs. the 6 dofs parameterizing the quadrotor position/ orientation in space. As a consequence, the quadrotor pose cannot track an arbitrary trajectory over time (e.g., it can hover on the spot only when horizontal). In this paper, we propose a novel actuation concept in which the quadrotor propellers are allowed to tilt about their axes w.r.t. the main quadrotor body. This introduces an additional set of 4 control inputs which provides full actuation to the quadrotor position/orientation. After deriving the dynamical model of the proposed quadrotor, we formally discuss its controllability properties and propose a nonlinear trajectory tracking controller based on dynamic feedback linearization techniques. The soundness of our approach is validated by means of simulation results.},

In this paper, we present a detailed physical model of the MAV and a maximum likelihood estimation scheme for determining the dominant parameters, such as inertia matrix, center of gravity (CoG) with respect to the IMU, and parameters related to the aerodynamics. To incorporate all information given by the IMU and the physical MAV model, we propose to use two process models in the optimization.

The resulting small (less than 5 kg) UAV is capable of full autonomous flight (including take-off and landing) of a pre-programmed, or easily configurable, custom mission. Furthermore, the autopilot manages the sensors measurements (i.e. beacons or cameras) to update the flying mission automatically in flight. Specific functionalities such as terrain following were developed and implemented. Ground station programming of the UAV is not needed, except compulsory monitoring, as the rescue mission can be accomplished in a full automatic mode.},
